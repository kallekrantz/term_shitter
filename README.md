# Term Shitter

Term shitter is a simple python terminal application meant to simplify 
the art of shitposting to friends and relatives.

The dream is for it to be able to navigate sources like imgur and 
post the images/gifs to several different chat services.


Currently only Discord is supported and no actual media
sources are implemented yet.
